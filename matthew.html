                    <h1>MATTHEW'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT(MCC)</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) is a measure of
                    the quality of a binary classification. It takes into
                    account true and false positives and negatives and is
                    generally regarded as a balanced measure, unlike other
                    measures such as precision and recall which may be biased
                    towards one class or the other. <br />The MCC is defined as:
                    <br />
                    <b>
                        MCC = (TP * TN - FP * FN) / sqrt((TP + FP) * (TP + FN) *
                        (TN + FP) * (TN + FN))
                    </b>
                    <br /><br />
                    Where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number
                    of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives, and
                    FN is the number of false negatives. The MCC ranges from -1
                    to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect prediction, a
                    value of 0 indicates no better than random prediction, and a
                    value of -1 indicates a completely incorrect prediction. The
                    MCC is often used in the evaluation of machine learning
                    models, particularly in the field of bioinformatics. It is
                    also useful when comparing models, as it takes into account
                    all four possible outcomes of a binary classification (true
                    positive, true negative, false positive, false negative) and
                    is therefore less sensitive to class imbalance than other
                    measures such as accuracy.
